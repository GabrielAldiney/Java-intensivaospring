# DSList - API for Game List Management

DSList is a Java Spring Back-end application that provides an API to manage game lists. The application allows retrieving detailed information about games, their lists, and performing operations such as replacing game lists.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring PostgreSQL Driver
- **H2 Database** (for development)
- **PostgreSQL** (for production)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## Domain Model

The application is based on the domain model below:

- **Game**: Represents a game, with attributes such as title, release year, genre, available platforms, score, and descriptions.
- **GameList**: Represents a custom game list.
- **Belonging**: Association class that defines the position of a game within a list.
